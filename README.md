# Quake4Mods
Welcome my mod, I like to call it College Student's pokemon inspired Quake 4 MOD, alternatively Stroggemon.

There's 5 interesting features to my mod. 

1. Player supported by a Strogg
At the beginning of the game you start out with the basic blaster. This blaster has now been transformed to spawn your Stroggemon.
On a normal shot the blaster either spawns or recalls your Stroggemon. The evolutions are automatically accounted for in each shot. 

2. Monster Experience System:
A very simple system, you kill mobs along with your strogg and it gains experience. When you reach a certain experience threshold, the Stroggemon evolves.
Currently there's only one evolution tree, the Marine -> Berserker -> Gladiator. 
Marine : Basic Strogg with melee attacks and gun fire.
Berserker : Full Melee Strogg with an electric attack that targets nearby enemies.
Gladiator : A giant Strogg with a huge laser and shield ability to go on both offense and defense.


3. Basic Strogg Commands
The blaster also has a way to control your partner on a very basic level. One charged shot sets it's state to idle.
Another charged shot from the blaster will set it's behavior back to active and follow you once more. 

4. Special Pickups
In this mod I've created 5 special pickups to help the player and their partner progress through the game. All pickups are activated on pickup if that wasn't obvious.
- Running Shoes (Napalm Ammo)
    The running shoes are given to the player early on in the game. The way I decided to emulate this was to increase the walk speed.
    In this game, the walk speed is triggered by holding SHIFT, so the same way running shoes are used by holding B.
    The running shoes are shown as a item pickup and adjusts the movement speed of the player while holding shift to simulate running.
- Health Packs (Grenade Ammo) 
    I made health packs for your partner in crime. Basically on pickup it heals your Strogg a fixed number of health points.
- Rare Candy (Nailgun Ammo) 
    The way rare candy works in this mod, it instantly takes your strogg to the next evolution stage as opposed to leveling up. 
- Strogg Roids (Hyperblaster Ammo)
    This is meant to be a uncommon pickup where it boosts the damage of your strogg partner by alot. Doing so enhances it's usefulness in combat.
- Super Strogg Roids (Dark Matter Gun Ammo) 
    The Super Strogg roids is a very rare pickup that will make your strogg partner invincible. He will become an undying killing machine because why not?
5. Unique Stroggemon Attacks
    The goal is to have 10 unique attacks spread across the 3 evolutions to spice up gameplay. These attacks are to be triggered by firing other guns under different names.
    For example the napalm gun will result in the Stroggemon using fire based attacks, same with the lightning gun doing lightning based attacks.
 
 The main functionality of the game is still here it's just a few quirks here and there. All you need to remember is: 
 Blaster Shot is Spawn/Recall, Blaster Charged Shot is Idle / Active
 SHIFT activates your running shoes after you've picked them up the first time.
 Different guns provide different attack variations. 
 
 Enjoy !
